# DST-for-IoT-data
Recent developments in Internet of Things for data collection and monitoring have
increased its potential applications in monitoring environmental phenomenon for data
dependent climate action. Internet of things devices are convenient for real time
monitoring and generate huge amount of data. The collected data can be uncertain and
erroneous, making traditional data analysis approaches redundant. Moreover, specific
approaches can be best suited to a dataset depending upon its nature. The present work
aims to tackle these challenges in the experimental dataset consisting of vital
parameters for water quality assessment of Ganga River. The dataset was collected
over a period of one year. The experiment based comparative analysis were performed
and the results show that the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory based data fusion
approach outperforms other similar methods and improves the classification accuracy.
